1) The ability to consistently store previous versions of code
2) Command line git has depreciated, and now the desktop application is the main way to use the system. I preferred the command line for git.
   - *I am confident that you can use both. The repository does not know which client is maintaining that at the moment. As long as you have the Git bash isntalled, it should work. I am  using Tortoise Git along with GH desktop myself.*
4) Can two repositories be merged? I'm not sure why this would have to happen, but I'm curious.
   - *Yes, though it is quite an extreme case. You can have more than one "origin" sources. But this is impractical and could do more harm than good.*
