1. Like:
- version control
2. Dislike:
- that I still find GitHub version control more confusing than the traditional "first_draft, updated_first_draft, final_draft, updated_final_draft" system
3. Question:
- where is the secret message?
  - hidden in the previous commits, see this commit https://github.com/beards-lab/Phys520/commit/ee1c788df43392093b93c48e81050e7798085ded
