1) I like github because it helps with version control for collabrations between contributors. It is also a great place to find useful source code and tutorials. 

2) One thing I do not enjoy about Github is the complexity of naming of functions such as fork, branch, push, pull. 

3) My question is that what is the name for the subject that stores many repos together? 
    For example, in the github for the R package tidyverse,       https://github.com/tidyverse, there are many repos belong to this page. Is this page a repo itself?
