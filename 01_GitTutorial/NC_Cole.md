1.) I like that you have the ability to view your repository as a chart to visualize your changes rather than just looking at a list.

2.) I don't like that you have to constantly return to the GitHub window to commit your changes. I think Github could be improved by connecting to the programming system you're using and providing a place to commit straight from your programming window.

3.) If you make a branch and are working on adding a section of code in the middle of your original code and you want to merge, will you have a merge error? Or is there a way to shift down lines of you original code? That way your new code will be inserted in the proper location without replacing any original code.
