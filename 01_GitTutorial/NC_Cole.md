1.) I like that you have the ability to view your repository as a chart to visualize your changes rather than just looking at a list.

2.) I don't like that you have to constantly return to the GitHub window to commit your changes. I think Github could be improved by connecting to the programming system you're using and providing a place to commit straight from your programming window.
    - good one! And it does! E.g. in visual studio code or in MatLab, you can commit directly. Unfortunately, the Spyder, which Dan is using for Python development does not have this feature yet (as far as I know).

3.) If you make a branch and are working on adding a section of code in the middle of your original code and you want to merge, will you have a merge error? Or is there a way to shift down lines of you original code? That way your new code will be inserted in the proper location without replacing any original code.
    = Totally! I was demonstrating just an edge case, where we were editing the same line, thus the Git cant really decide what is better. But for a simple additions inbetween existing codes, the Git merges automatically.
