I like how easily you can communicate and work on projects with other people 
I dislike how I have not used it and became familiar with Github in other classes 
What is an example of a bioinformatic usage of github? 
  - *Same as others, storing codes for backup and collaboration. What is even more important for science is to store version of software associated with published papers. That is the only way to be able to fully reproduce the research. For some examples you can see e.g. https://github.com/beards-lab *
