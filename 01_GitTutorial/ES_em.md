  1. I like that it is an extremely organized system for developing code. 
  2. I dislike that using Github is not intuitive. I feel pretty confused most of the time that I am using Github.
     - takes time, like any other new stuff
  4. I am using MacOS, is there any way to get rid of the .DS_store file that persists in my 'changes' to commit? I have already chosen to send it to the .gitignore file, but it did not fix the problem.
     - adding .DS_store into .gitignore should do the trick. I have just updated the .gitignore, try pulling from **"upstream"** or fetching your github.com repository to match the upstream.
