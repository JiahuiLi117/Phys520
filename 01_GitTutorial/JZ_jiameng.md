Git could track each version of documents without losing important changes. What’s more, it makes people all over the world be accessible to the codes and have opportunity to edit codes. 

Since I was new to Git and still learn how to play with it, sometimes it seems a little bit abstract to me.

Question: sometimes it shows ”conflict” and couldn’t merge. What kind of things are conflicted to each other?
