1. Git allows people working on a project to easily work together and share the same up-to-date files. It also allows a lot of important work to be open for anyone to look at.

2. I am still getting used to the interface of Git and there are a lot of ways to handle Git (command line, website, GitHub Desktop) which makes it confusing for me.

3. Can I write into files within a repository from the command line?
