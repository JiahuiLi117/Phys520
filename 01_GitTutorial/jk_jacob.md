1) I think github desktop is sleak and easy to use for managing repositories.
2) I think a lot of the terminology in git isn't self explanitory
3) Why does git command line exist if github desktop is a thing?
   - *First, Git comes from the Unix people. They love command line. They might die without touching the keyboard regularly :) Most of the git tools are just a GUI on top of these commands. Second, it is often used in the help files, because that is the right way to do, regardless in which menu item or under which name it is hidden in different git clients. GitHub desktop is only one of such clients. I personally find nice, that all the commands are somwhat hidden from us. You can however grab any other tool to use with Git or GitHub.*
