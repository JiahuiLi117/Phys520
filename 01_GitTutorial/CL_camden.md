1. I like that GitHub has clear and thorough documentation.
2. I haven't found anything I don't like about GitHub yet.
3. Do tags exist only in GitHub, or are they a feature of git repositories (whether they are managed in GitHub or not)?
   - *It is a general feature. You can right-click any commit in GH-Destkop and select Create Tag. Remember, that whatever you can do with **GitHub Desktop** (not using any web features), you can also do with ANY other git client (and usually more). Tag is just a pointer on a specific commit, immutable in time. Github.com then presents all the tags and releases nice and pretty.*
