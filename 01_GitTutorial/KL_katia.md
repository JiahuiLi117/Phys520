#Like about GitHub: able to revert changes easily and find old versions (seems hard to lose your work), also like that it can be compatible with R
#Dislike about GitHub: steep learning curve, lots of steps make it challenging to remember the correct order when starting out
#Question about GitHub: I am still unsure how to start a new file on GitHub, or is it better to import existing data files into GitHub?
  - I do not perfectly understand the issue (do you mean "repository?"), but generally both way work. Are you begining a new project? Create a repository. Add files and the GitHub destkop will notice and offers to commit them. Are you in the middle of a work and decide to start a repository? Make it and copy all the files there. You can even just drag and drop your files to github.com and not have you local repository at all, but then you are lacking the neat stuff, like GH desktop noticing you changing files or adding new one.
  - Give a try both ways and you perhaps realize it is more or less the same.
