## Tenth commit assignment
1. I like that GitHub allows me to track changes and go back to previous versions of my work.\
2. I dislike the fact that there are a lot of commands to remember.
   - *not THAT much, unless you insist on using the command line :) But I understand.*
3.  Is there a way to make sure that no one else is working on the same file as you to avoid a merge error?
    - *No tools will ever eradicate the need to communicate within the team. That said:*
      1.  *make sure you commit and push as often as possible. Thus, your collague would have a most up-to date version, avoiding conflicts.*
      2.  *Split up the work, so it is not probable to overlap and finally,*
      3.  *do not be afraid of conflicts. They happen from time to time, yet they can be simply resolved and usually it is done not in the ugly notepad, but e.g. visual studio code provides simple GUI helper.*
